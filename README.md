# Front End Tech Week 4

I had fun working on a To-Do style app. I didn't just learn how to make a to-do style app, but now I learned a couple important things:
what Arrow Functions are really doing,
onclick must be lowercase C,
brosed some syntax resources for createEventListener,
learned how to properly use JS's getElementById(); and,
How forms/table data are created, read, written and deleted

I think I might be using this a lot more. Cool!
